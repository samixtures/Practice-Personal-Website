        <p>I'm a third year computer science major always looking to learn more through
            information and experience! I'm interested in web development, artificial intelligence
            and algorithms and how my interests can help people throughout the world 🌎.
            <br>
            <br>
            Some of my hobbies include reading 📚, watching videos to help me learn useful information 💻,
            spending time with my family and friends 👨‍👩‍👧‍👦, playing basketball 🏀, and cooooding ⌨

                Used javascript, html, and css to create this task manager to help me (you guessed it)
                manage tasks on my computer better. All of the tasks are editable, there is a remove button,
                there is a button to cross out tasks, and there is a light and dark mode (all shown in the gif above)!

                While learning python I decided to create a game known to be simple in python 
                but with a change that would make it more enjoyable for my playing experience.
                I practiced basic things in python like using loops, if statements, and using the pygame library.

            <p>
                Since everyone loves cats and I wanted to create an app I developed
                this cat randomizer app which does exactly what it sounds like (and what it shows in the gif above).
                I developed it using the react native javascript framework, so this app works on both ios and android devices :).

            <p>
                Both of my older siblings moved out last year and I wanted me and my family to always
                know what the time, temperature, and sky status were of their locations at all times.
                I used two REST APIs to get all of the information present so everyone in the family can know
                about each other's locations at any given moment.
